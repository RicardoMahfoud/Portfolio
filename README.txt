Web Design Final Project - Ricardo Mahfoud

6 HTML pages: 
index: main page containing a changing area that showcases projects - can be clicked to go to projects details 
projects: page containing projects I made a
bout: contains my resume (all about me) 
3 Project detail pages: one for each project to showcase - can be accessed by clicking on a project

5 CSS files: 
NavBar: common css between all pages for the navigation which uses flexbox 
about - index - projects: one file for each html page 
ProjectDetails: a common css file between the 3 project pages

2 JS files: 
hamburger menu logic which is common for all pages
image transition logic for index page

Tried to cover most class material like so: 
-Navigation was done using Flexbox 
-Projects page was done using CSS grid 
-About page was done using w33 schools styling and elements

In the project details page, I embedded a Youtube video showcasing the project
Also there is a direct link to download the code

The website was tested on all screensizes above 500px (below that are not relevant)
The media queries are on 1600px and 800px
at 1600px we break the navigation and put the social links at the bottom of the page
at 800px we enable the hamburger menu
